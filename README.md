# Waste-Management-System
"Waste Management System" is a java web project which provides a platform for any individual or a company to purchase as well as sell their recyclable products such as papers, plastics , dresses online.
It acts as a great floor for any customer who wishes to dispose their wastes from their home at their desired time. On the other hand the collectors also get continuous work through our application. In due course their income would also become stabilized providing them with a steady job. The customers who are selling their products through our application are provided with an option for claiming a coupon equal to the amount sold rather than cash on delivery. These coupons can be used to shop online in other websites. Using our application apart from selling, the customers can even request for the recycled products. This reduces the waste being sent to the landfills and incinerators. Thus our application creates jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industries and saves our environment by reducing pollution.
